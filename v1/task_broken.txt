Okay, I understand. I will break down the task of scraping movie data and answering the questions into smaller, manageable steps.

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preparation**

1.  **Scrape the Wikipedia Page:**
    *   **Action:** Use a web scraping library (e.g., `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` in Python) to fetch the HTML content from the specified URL:  `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films`
    *   **Goal:** Obtain the raw HTML data of the webpage.
    *   **Code Snippet Example (Python):**

        ```python
        import requests
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

        url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films"
        response = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        # Now you have the 'soup' object to work with the HTML
        ```

2.  **Parse and Extract Data:**
    *   **Action:**  Identify the HTML elements containing the movie data (likely a table). Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup to extract the relevant information: Rank, Title, Worldwide Gross, Year, etc.
    *   **Goal:** Create a structured dataset (e.g., a list of dictionaries or a Pandas DataFrame) containing the extracted movie data.
    *   **Note:** Carefully inspect the HTML structure of the Wikipedia page to identify the correct table and column headers. Handle any potential inconsistencies or data cleaning needs (e.g., removing '$', commas from numbers).
    *   **Code Snippet Example (Python):**

        ```python
        table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'wikitable sortable'}) # adjust the class name as needed
        if table:
            headers = [th.text.strip() for th in table.find_all('th')]
            movie_data = []
            for row in table.find_all('tr')[1:]: # Skip the header row
                cells = row.find_all('td')
                if len(cells) >= len(headers):
                    data = {}
                    for i, header in enumerate(headers):
                        data[header] = cells[i].text.strip()
                    movie_data.append(data)

            print(movie_data) # Print the extracted data to verify it
        else:
            print("Table not found")
        ```

3.  **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
    *   **Action:**  Clean and transform the extracted data. This might include:
        *   Converting gross revenue and year to numerical data types.
        *   Handling missing values (if any).
        *   Creating new columns if needed (e.g., a "before\_2020" boolean column).
    *   **Goal:**  Prepare the data for analysis, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

**Phase 2: Answering the Questions**

1.  **Question 1: How many $2 bn movies were released before 2020?**
    *   **Action:** Filter the dataset for movies with gross revenue >= $2 billion AND a release year before 2020. Count the number of movies in the filtered dataset.
    *   **Goal:** Provide the count as a JSON string.

2.  **Question 2: Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?**
    *   **Action:** Filter the dataset for movies with gross revenue >= $1.5 billion. Find the movie with the minimum release year among the filtered movies. Return movie title.
    *   **Goal:** Provide the movie title as a JSON string.

3.  **Question 3: What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?**
    *   **Action:** Assume 'Rank' is available from the scraped data and `Peak` refers to the Worldwide Gross.
        *   Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 'Rank' and 'Worldwide Gross' (convert the gross value to numeric).
    *   **Goal:** Provide the correlation coefficient as a JSON string.

4.  **Question 4: Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it. Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."` under 100,000 bytes.**
    *   **Action:**
        1.  **Data Preparation:** Convert 'Rank' and 'Worldwide Gross' to numeric types.
        2.  **Plotting:** Use a plotting library (e.g., `matplotlib` in Python) to create the scatterplot.
            *   Scatter plot 'Rank' vs. 'Worldwide Gross'.
            *   Calculate and plot a linear regression line (dotted red) using the appropriate libraries.
        3.  **Encoding to Base64:** Save the plot to a temporary image file (e.g., PNG). Read the image file and convert it to a base64-encoded string.  Ensure the image size is under 100,000 bytes.
    *   **Goal:** Generate a base64-encoded data URI string of the scatterplot.

**Phase 3: Output Formatting**

1.  **Format Output:**
    *   Create a JSON array of strings for the answers to questions 1, 2, and 3.
    *   The answer for question 4 is the base-64 encoded image data URI.
    *   Combine all the answers into a single JSON file.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully manage potential issues (e.g., website structure changes, network errors, data inconsistencies).
*   **Library Installation:** Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and potentially `scipy` for regression if needed).
*   **Web Scraping Ethics:** Be respectful of the website's terms of service and avoid excessive scraping (e.g., implement delays between requests).
*   **Code Clarity and Comments:** Write clean, well-commented code for readability and maintainability.
