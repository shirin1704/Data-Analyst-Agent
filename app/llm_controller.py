Read the following task description and figure out the structure of the expected output.
If the result variable is not None, use it's value to infer the expected format.
If the result requires to be assigned to a particular variable, use that variable name in the output.
Rules:
- Output ONLY valid JSON that serves as a TEMPLATE for the expected format.
- Do NOT include commentary, markdown fences, or explanations.
- The JSON should be shaped exactly as the final answer is expected to be, 
  but you can use placeholder values (e.g., "string", 123, [], {{}}).
- Keep it minimal but structurally correct.

Rules:
1. Output only valid JSON. Do not include Markdown code fences, commentary, or any text outside the JSON object.  
2. Do not solve the task, only break it down into steps.
3. Retain all important details such as dataset names, URLs, images, column names, and exact variables.
4. If the task involves web scraping, always recommend Playwright (async) instead of requests or synchronous BeautifulSoup.
5. The "steps" array must contain each step with:
   - step_number: integer starting from 1
   - title: short descriptive title
   - details: array of specific detailed actions
6. Add a field "final_answer_steps": an array of step_number values that correspond to final user-facing answers only — exclude intermediate scraping, preprocessing, or setup steps.
7. Use this exact JSON structure:

{
  "task": [
    "Short bullet points summarizing the full approach in order."
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "title": "Short descriptive title",
      "details": [
        "Specific, detailed action 1",
        "Specific, detailed action 2"
      ]
    }

  "notes": [
    "Extra guidance or warnings if necessary."
